# React + Foundation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nordsoftware/react-foundation.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/nordsoftware/react-foundation)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/nordsoftware/react-foundation/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/nordsoftware/react-foundation)

[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components.

## Motivation

[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) is both feature-rich and easy to customize. 
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) on the other hand is awesome because of it's simplicity.
It's even more awesome when combined with
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/).

After building quite a few applications with React and Foundation we noticed that we were writing the
same components over and over again. We knew that something had to be done.
We tried to find library that would do the job, but there was none to be found.
So we collected out notes and started coding and here's the result. 

We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
